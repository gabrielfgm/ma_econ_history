## The perception of decline


> "It must be clear to everyone that we are under the shadow of a business depression...", <br> -*Banker's Magazine*, October 1883

<br>

> "Since 1862 the tide of agricultural propsperity had ceased to flow; after 1874 it turned and rapidly ebbed" <br> -Lord Ernley, *English Farming Past and Present*, 1927

<br>

> "There was, in fact, a continuous output of discussions, speeches, books, reports, and pamphlets, which prove, at least, that people thought they were depressed ... 1873 to 1896 was a period when people said there was a great depression." <br> -Beales, "The Great Depression in Industry and Trade", 1934

Might begin with the name: Great Depression

+ Now if you tell someone you spent the morning in a lecture on the Great Depression they will almost certainly think you are talking about the 1930s

widespred discussion of decline

+ 2 royal commission in 70s and 90s on agriculture
+ 2 on trade and industry
+ 1 on the monetary system
+ Widespread discussion in the Political Economy Club and House of Commons

+ Address given to the Royal Statistical Society in 1879

+ Since 1873 **prices of goods declining**!

## The fall in British prices

```{r price_plot, fig.align='center', fig.retina=3, out.width="100%", fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

library(tidyverse)

df <- read_csv("uk_cpi_1850-1914.csv", skip = 1)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year, `Retail Price Index (2010 = 100)`)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  theme_lecture + 
  annotate('rect', xmin=1873, xmax = 1896, 
           ymin = min(df$`Retail Price Index (2010 = 100)`), 
           ymax = max(df$`Retail Price Index (2010 = 100)`),

The drop in prices

+ Greg Clark retail price index
+ Clearly confirms what contemporaries noted -- prolonged fall in prices in the period of the Great Depression
+ **Are price declines a depression**? 
    - Not necessarily! We call this *deflation*
        * Good for lenders bad for debtors
        * Depends **what** prices are falling

### What might explain the fall in prices?

> "There is an immense **diminution in the production of gold.**"<br> -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

+ Less **supply** of gold $\rightarrow$ lower prices

> "...the recent course of prices... is the result in part of the diminished production **and the increased extroardinary demands upon the supply of gold.**"<br> -Giffen, *Contemporary Review*, 1885.

+ Less **demand** for gold $\rightarrow$ lower prices

> "The prime cause affecting prices, it seems to us, is plain enough, namely, the **excessive production** in all things, the use of machinery, the fruitfullness of the earth, far outstripping the wants of man combined with his power to purchase..."<br> -*Banker's Magazine*, 1885.

+ Increased **productivity** $\rightarrow$ lower prices

#### But recall $MV = \sum_i(p_i \times q_i)$, where $M$ is stock of money, $V$ velocity of money, $p_i$ and $q_i$ the price and quantity of transaction $i$.

### Why were prices falling?

+ US Crime of '73: **A global phenomenon**

> "There is a greater strain upon gold through the discarding of silver in very important countries..."<br> -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

Productivity gains in transport and american farming pushed down prices of **traded** goods

+ Things that were harder to trade were more protected, for instance fresh milk
+ In addition, the rise in **real wages** led to Britains buying more meat and drink
+ Plus, grains are an **input** into the cost of producing animals and animal products

> "...the soapmakers, sorry for themselves though they often were, never really felt the pinch of the 'Great Depression'. Quite the contrary, in fact, for **the very influences which, by producing low wholesale prices, worked against the capital goods industries, worked in favour of consumer goods** by raising retail customers' purchasing power." <br> -Reader, "The United Kingdom Soapmakers' Association and the English Soap Trade, 1867-1896", pp. 83.

## Was there a Great Depression?

> "As regards the 'Great Depression' itself, surely the major outcome of modern research has been to destroy once and for all the idea of the existence of such a period in any unified sense." <br> -Saul, *The Myth of the Great Depression, 1873-1896*, pp. 54.

#### Arrighi: Fall in the rate of profit

> "...there is no contradition in saying that there was a Great Depression at a time of continuing expansion in production and investment. On the contrary, the Great Depression was *not* a myth, precisely because production and trade in Britain and in the world-economy at large had expanded and were still expanding *too* rapidly for profits to be maintained." *Long Twentieth Century*, p. 168.

#### Landes: widening competition

> "The shift from monopoly to competition was probably the most important single factor in setting the mood for European industrial and commercial enterprise. Economic growth was now also economic struggle -- struggle that served to separate the strong from the weak, to discourage some and toughen others, to favour the new ...nations at the expense of the old." *Unbound Prometheus*, p. 240.

#### Lewis: Competition, Agricultural Production

> "What we are witnessing is a turning point in British fortunes. Exports of iron and steel products reached a peak in 1882, and never regained this volume until 1906... [Germany & the USA] would wrest their own markets from the British, then they would wrest their neighbours' markets... finally... defeat the British iron and steel industry on its home ground..." -*Growth & Fluctuations, 1870-1913*, p. 54.

<br>
> "In sum we find as follows. First, the original cause... lies in changes in the rate of flow of agricultural output..." -*Growth & Flunctuations, 1870-1913*, p. 92.
