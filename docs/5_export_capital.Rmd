#### How to read a share price list

![:scale 90%](read_prices.png)

+ **Stock**, e.g. "Guatemala 6% Sterling": Guatemalan sovereign debt pays 6% interest in sterling on nominal value
+ **Issue price**: when they created the loan what it sold for
+ **Original issue**: nominal value of debt (what is owed)
+ **Sinking fund**: is there a special fund for repayment? 
+ **Amount of loan unredeemed**: if paid back gradually how much left?
+ **Par**: nominal value of stock i.e. how much will you get paid back per stock you own. 
+ **Prices of the month**: what has the stock been trading for? E.g. Guatemala is not being traded this month
+ **Last Business Done**: last trade price. Guatemala 6% at 42 -- very low!
+ **Dividends**: where and when you can collect the interest
+ How to compute bond yield: $dividend/price = (.06 \times 100)/42 = 6/42 = .143 = 14.3\%$
