## The perception of decline


&gt; "It must be clear to everyone that we are under the shadow of a business depression...", &lt;br&gt; -*Banker's Magazine*, October 1883

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "Since 1862 the tide of agricultural propsperity had ceased to flow; after 1874 it turned and rapidly ebbed" &lt;br&gt; -Lord Ernley, *English Farming Past and Present*, 1927

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "There was, in fact, a continuous output of discussions, speeches, books, reports, and pamphlets, which prove, at least, that people thought they were depressed ... 1873 to 1896 was a period when people said there was a great depression." &lt;br&gt; -Beales, "The Great Depression in Industry and Trade", 1934 

???

Might begin with the name: Great Depression

+ Now if you tell someone you spent the morning in a lecture on the Great Depression they will almost certainly think you are talking about the 1930s

widespred discussion of decline

+ 2 royal commission in 70s and 90s on agriculture
+ 2 on trade and industry
+ 1 on the monetary system
+ Widespread discussion in the Political Economy Club and House of Commons

## The fall in British prices

&lt;img src="4_great_depression_files/figure-html/price_plot-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???

The drop in prices

+ Greg Clark retail price index
+ Clearly confirms what contemporaries noted -- prolonged fall in prices in the period of the Great Depression
+ **Are price declines a depression**? 
    - Not necessarily! We call this *deflation*
        * Good for lenders bad for debtors
        * Depends **what** prices are falling

---

### What might explain the fall in prices?

&gt; "There is an immense **diminution in the production of gold.**"&lt;br&gt; -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

+ Less **supply** of gold `\(\rightarrow\)` lower prices

&gt; "...the recent course of prices... is the result in part of the diminished production **and the increased extroardinary demands upon the supply of gold.**"&lt;br&gt; -Giffen, *Contemporary Review*, 1885.

+ Less **demand** for gold `\(\rightarrow\)` lower prices

&gt; "The prime cause affecting prices, it seems to us, is plain enough, namely, the **excessive production** in all things, the use of machinery, the fruitfullness of the earth, far outstripping the wants of man combined with his power to purchase..."&lt;br&gt; -*Banker's Magazine*, 1885.

+ Increased **productivity** `\(\rightarrow\)` lower prices

#### But recall `\(MV = \sum_i(p_i \times q_i)\)`, where `\(M\)` is stock of money, `\(V\)` velocity of money, `\(p_i\)` and `\(q_i\)` the price and quantity of transaction `\(i\)`.

### Why were prices falling?

+ US Crime of '73: **A global phenomenon**

&gt; "There is a greater strain upon gold through the discarding of silver in very important countries..."&lt;br&gt; -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

Productivity gains in transport and american farming pushed down prices of **traded** goods

+ Things that were harder to trade were more protected, for instance fresh milk
+ In addition, the rise in **real wages** led to Britains buying more meat and drink
+ Plus, grains are an **input** into the cost of producing animals and animal products

&gt; "...the sort of man who had bread and cheese for his dinner 40 years ago now demands a chop." Graham 1899

## New opportunities!

&gt; "...the soapmakers, sorry for themselves though they often were, never really felt the pinch of the 'Great Depression'. Quite the contrary, in fact, for **the very influences which, by producing low wholesale prices, worked against the capital goods industries, worked in favour of consumer goods** by raising retail customers' purchasing power." &lt;br&gt; -Reader, "The United Kingdom Soapmakers' Association and the English Soap Trade, 1867-1896", pp. 83.

## Was there a Great Depression?

&gt; "As regards the 'Great Depression' itself, surely the major outcome of modern research has been to destroy once and for all the idea of the existence of such a period in any unified sense." &lt;br&gt; -Saul, *The Myth of the Great Depression, 1873-1896*, pp. 54.

#### Arrighi: Fall in the rate of profit

&gt; "...there is no contradition in saying that there was a Great Depression at a time of continuing expansion in production and investment. On the contrary, the Great Depression was *not* a myth, precisely because production and trade in Britain and in the world-economy at large had expanded and were still expanding *too* rapidly for profits to be maintained." *Long Twentieth Century*, p. 168.

### Interpretations

#### Landes: widening competition

&gt; "The shift from monopoly to competition was probably the most important single factor in setting the mood for European industrial and commercial enterprise. Economic growth was now also economic struggle -- struggle that served to separate the strong from the weak, to discourage some and toughen others, to favour the new ...nations at the expense of the old." *Unbound Prometheus*, p. 240.

### Interpretations

#### Lewis: Competition, Agricultural Production

&gt; "What we are witnessing is a turning point in British fortunes. Exports of iron and steel products reached a peak in 1882, and never regained this volume until 1906... [Germany &amp; the USA] would wrest their own markets from the British, then they would wrest their neighbours' markets... finally... defeat the British iron and steel industry on its home ground..." -*Growth &amp; Fluctuations, 1870-1913*, p. 54.

&lt;br&gt;
&gt; "In sum we find as follows. First, the original cause... lies in changes in the rate of flow of agricultural output..." -*Growth &amp; Flunctuations, 1870-1913*, p. 92.
