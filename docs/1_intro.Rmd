### **About me**

Name: **Gabriel Geisler Mesevage** (Call me Gabe/Gabriel; he/him) <br>
Field: **Economic and Financial History**

I'm really interested in understanding asset price bubbles in history, how people understood investments, and how markets produced information for investors. I've worked on company promotion, white-collar crime, the financial press, links between politicians and companies, and rating agencies, all in the 19th century, mostly in the UK. I've also done some work on networks: how and when they are useful objects and how to work with network data. I like making graphs.

# Course Mechanics

## Assessment

.large[
+ 1 $\times$ 4,000 word essay **due 23 Apr 2020 - 16:00!!**
    - KCL is *unrelenting* about deadlines -- must be submitted by 15:59:59 on the day!
    - I have no power to grant extensions
    - If you need an extension write to [history@kcl.ac.uk](history@kcl.ac.uk)
]

--

.large[
+ For essay **you will come up with a question**
    - Come discuss your question with me
    - Must be related to course (obviously) but can be interpreted broadly
+ In weeks 6-10 we will set aside class time for each of you to discuss your essay question/approach and get feedback (not graded)

# Britain in 1850

![cp](christalpalace.jpg)

---

## 1850 as an apogee?

.large[
+ Highest GDP/capita worldwide 
    - (we think)
    - (not highest wages!)
+ Military security
    - Period of 'Pax Britannica' post-Napolean pre-Crimea
+ Rising prosperity
]

## But

.large[
+ Social dislocation of industrial transformation

### Globalization and Deglobalization in Historical Perspective

![orourke](orourke.png)
<br>
![daunton](daunton.png)
---

## The first economic globalization?

.large[
+ In quantitative terms first period of intense economic integration
+ Unrestricted capital movement
+ Largely unrestricted population movements
+ Major liberalization of trade
    - Some direct political moves to free-trade (e.g. Corn Laws)
    - Some a product of technological change (improved transport, refrigerated shipping, etc.)
    
+ Political consequences of economic integration?
]

---

## Globalization and politics


### Why did Globalization collapse?

.large[ 
+ 3 hypotheses (James, *The End of Globalization*, 2001)
    - Speculative finance
    - Nationalist resentment of distributional consequences (pressure on wages, sectors)
    - Growth of national structures to cope with global forces

> "The history of the modern world economy illustrates two points. First, economies work best when they are open to the world. Second, open economies work best when their governments address the sources of dissatisfaction with global capitalism." (Frieden, *Global Capitalism*, p. 476)
]

---

## Globalization and politics

### The distributional consequences of integration

+ The Trilemma
    + The 'inconsistent quartet' with trade 
    + Expanded to 'incompatible quintet' with migration/labor market

## The consequences of economic globalization?

### A cause of the Great Depression?

> "To the extent that the Depression was caused by malfunctioning international capital markets, or the gold standard that was thought at the time to underpin them, we have yet another case of globalization undermining itself, since the Depression was the major cause of interwar protectionism" (O'Rourke 2019, 371-2).

### A cause of WWI?

> "...capital flows and technology transfer helped Russia converge on the established powers. This disrupted pre-existing geopolitical equilibria and led Germany in particular to devise military strategies to counter the threat. ...the spread of the Industrial Revolution to Germany had earlier undermined the geopolitical equilibrium in Europe.." (O'Rourke 2019, 373).
